I’m a U.S. Navy veteran transitioning into a **Cybersecurity Engineer / SOC Analyst** role, with hands-on experience across detection engineering, threat hunting, incident response, and offensive security. I bring an operator mindset built in high-accountability environments and apply it to modern security operations.

I hold the **Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)** and am currently completing an **800+ hour full-time cybersecurity apprenticeship through RapidAscent**, where I build and operate security capabilities across simulated enterprise environments. My work spans Active Directory security, SIEM-based detection, network forensics, and red- and blue-team operations.

My background includes five years working with autonomous robotic systems in the U.S. Navy, where I led technical operations, produced concise incident and root-cause reports, and maintained mission-critical systems under time pressure. That experience translates directly into disciplined incident response, documentation, and operational reliability in security roles.

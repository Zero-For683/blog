## About Me

https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-barbir/

I’m a cybersecurity analyst with hands-on experience across SOC operations, threat hunting, and offensive security. I hold the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification and currently work through an intensive apprenticeship focused on building and operating security capabilities in simulated enterprise environments. I also maintain an active Secret clearance.

My background includes incident response, log and PCAP analysis, detection engineering concepts, and end-to-end attack simulations across Windows and Linux systems. I focus on understanding how attacks work in practice, how they appear in telemetry, and how defenders can detect, respond to, and remediate them effectively.

This blog documents my work building and operating a SOC, conducting investigations, developing detections, and analyzing adversary behavior. The goal is to produce clear, practical writeups that emphasize reasoning, tradeoffs, and lessons learned rather than step-by-step walkthroughs or tool-specific tutorials.
